## Introduction
Hello, I am Charmian. I graduted from college a year ago and found that I should see COVID-19 as a opportunity to equip myself with more skills set and here I am.

## Cloud Research

I have researched my cloud certification exam path and I think will join the online exam preperation course and hopefully I can finish my first Cloud exam in 1-2 weeks.
